If you haven't added something to the Assets folder through Unity Editor, add it here.
Then drag/drop it into Unity to work on these in the open Unity project.
Use this folder to push out your assets if you're behind in pushing/pulling.
This will make sure they get to the main repository on Github without merge errors in the project.
